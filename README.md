# ID Photo Printing Template

This repository contains a LaTeX template designed for printing ID photos with cut marks.

## Description

The template arranges ID photos in a grid format on an A4 paper, with cut marks around each photo for easy cutting. It's ideal for printing standard size (350 x 450mm) ID photos, such as passport photos, driving licences, etc.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Replace the placeholder image paths in the LaTeX file with the paths to your actual ID photos.
   - Use relative paths if the images are in the same directory or a subdirectory of the LaTeX file.
   - Use absolute paths if the images are located elsewhere on your system.
3. Compile the LaTeX file to produce a PDF.
   - You can use a LaTeX editor or command line tools like `pdflatex`.
4. Print the PDF on photo-quality paper for best results.

## Customization

You can customize the following in the LaTeX template:
- Photo size (default is set for standard ID photo dimensions)
- Number of photos per row
- Spacing between the photos
